# My Coffee Hobby

Coffee has become a big part of my daily routine. I am always excited to wake up and make my latte in the morning and try something new. I am not the most skilled but I will sit down and talk coffee with anyone for as long as they will allow.

## Equipment

- **Breville Bambino**: This is my go-to espresso machine. Nothing fancy but it gets the job done.
- **Baratza Encore Espresso Grinder**: I bought this grinder when I was still doing pour over coffee but I knew I wanted to upgrade my equipment.
- **Loveramics Cups**: For my birthday I had different groups of family members choose 3 different cups from Loveramics huge catalog to add some additional meaning to my morning routine.

## Coffee Beans

I always have some sort of Costco whole beans on hand for my daily brews, but I like to try different and higher-quality beans whenever possible. I buy locally from small roasters, both to support local businesses and to experiment with different flavors and blends. I wish I could say I can taste the difference in nice beans, and the "floral" aspects of the coffee, but I will get their slowly. I try and attend coffee and wine tasting courses to improve this skill.

## Latte Art

Latte art has been a huge work in progress. As soon as I feel like I am making forward progress I proceed to make the worst latte art I have ever seen in my life. I still enjoy getting better though and someday I will make those fancy patterns you see in coffee shops.

## Fun Flavors

I like to making unique syrups to add some personality to my drinks. My favorite experiment so far has been a strawberries and cream syrup. My peanut butter syrup on the otherhand was a nightmare. I loved the flavor it gave but no matter what I did I cnanot get rid of the gritty texture.

## Next Additions

- **Gaggia Classic**: I’m planning to get a Gaggia Classic soon and mod it. I’m excited to join the Gaggiuino community and contribute to the mods and software.
- **Matcha Lattes and Chai**: I also want to expand my at-home barista arsenal by experimenting with matcha lattes and making chai. I love making coffee but being able to make a wide variety of coffee shop drinks has always been satisfying to me.

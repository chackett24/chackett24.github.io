#Volos Options Backtesting

I currently work with Volos Portfolio Solutions, a fintech company that helps investors build and evaluate systematic options strategies. My role involves designing and analyzing rule-based strategies using the Volos Strategy Engine, often focused on multi-leg ETF options structures like covered calls, put spreads, and volatility-based trades.

Over time, I've become especially focused on improving the way strategy performance is analyzed and communicated. Volos provides a deep set of data, but it often requires time and experience to interpret. I'm working on tools that help streamline common analytical workflows, both for the team and potentially for clients. These tools aim to make it easier to understand how a strategy behaves and what drives its performance.

The goal is to help users, regardless of their background, get a clearer picture of their strategies without digging through raw spreadsheets. This includes visual dashboards, quick summaries, and exploratory tools that delivers key information with minimal effort.

I regularly collaborate with others across the company to make sure these tools are useful in real-world analysis. Whether it's making internal research more efficient or helping a client build intuition about their portfolio, I see this work as an important link between data, product, and decision-making.

This experience brings together financial modeling, data analysis, and thoughtful design. It's rewarding to work on systems that not only generate insights, but also make those insights easier to understand and apply.

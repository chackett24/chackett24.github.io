#MIT Lincoln Laboratory

At MIT Lincoln Laboratory, I worked with the Superconducting Qubit team on projects related to quantum computing. My focus was on developing tools to improve how experiments were calibrated, with the goal of reducing the need for manual, human-driven tuning.

The main objective of the project was to make qubit calibration more efficient and precise. Traditional methods relied heavily on hands-on adjustment and researcher intuition, which could be time-consuming and difficult to rely on. By creating systems that automated and optimized this process, we helped free up researchers to focus on experimental design, while improving consistency and reducing overhead.

The work combined experimental feedback, algorithmic tuning, and software development. I collaborated closely with physicists to ensure that the tools integrated smoothly into existing lab workflows and made a meaningful impact on research efficiency.

This experience gave me a firsthand look at how thoughtful infrastructure can remove bottlenecks in high-stakes research. By transforming a manual process into a streamlined system, we enabled faster experimentation and more reliable results.

It was a great example of how practical software and systems thinking can support breakthroughs in fields like quantum computing.

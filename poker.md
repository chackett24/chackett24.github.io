# Live Poker and EV Thinking

I play $1/$2 live cash at Wind Creek, where I’ve been steadily building my game and now taking shots at $2/$5. I started by studying through PokerCoaching.com and grinding online to build up a bankroll. After moving to Bethlehem for grad school, I took a shot at $1/$2 live, and it’s been going well. I’m averaging over 20 big blinds an hour and now focusing on $2/$5.

Poker has been a great way to sharpen how I think about expected value and making decisions under pressure with incomplete information. Every hand is about finding edges, weighing probabilities, and making +EV decisions that pay off in the long run.

It reminds me a lot of what I enjoy in quant work: developing a +EV strategy, analyzing your assumptions about the table of players you’re at, and trusting your process over the outcome of any single hand or trade. It’s not about playing perfectly or winning every hand, it’s about consistently capitalizing on weaknesses in how others play.

I’ve also learned a lot about risk management, game selection, and staying mentally sharp over long sessions. I have found that the kind of discipline and edge awareness translates well into systematic trading, strategy design, and the mentality of what a winning strategy means in the long run.
